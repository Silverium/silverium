## About
This is a project built on top of [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) which is a React renderer for the terminal.

The app downloads some information about vessels and how they do the "Port Calls". Then it organizes the data and it displays the schedules of container vessels.
It can be open with [this link](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/Silverium/container-vessel-schedules/main) directly in a small VM of codesandbox.io
