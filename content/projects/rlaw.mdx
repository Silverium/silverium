Website built on top of [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) and Angular. It is a static website, but it has a contact form that sends an email to the owner of the website.


It can be opened in a browser, but it is also a PWA, so it can be installed on a mobile device. Visit it at [rlaw.es](https://rlaw.es/) or at github pages [silverium.github.io/rlaw](https://silverium.github.io/rlaw/)
